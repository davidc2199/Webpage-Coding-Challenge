# Webpage-Coding-Challenge


Solution to the following challenge: 
Build a web page that consists of two dropdown lists and a submit button. 
The first dropdown list is called Meals and has 3 options [Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner] and the second one is called Fruits and also has 3 options  [Apple, Orange, Banana]. You want to build a knowledge base that will help you guess/predict what fruit people eat during what meal. At the beginning, the knowledge base is empty. If your first submission is a combination of Breakfast -> Orange, then the next time someone selects Breakfast from the Meals dropdown list, the Fruits dropdown list should get preset to Orange, being the most popular breakfast fruit so far.
